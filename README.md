"I developed a fully responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. The website features a sleek, modern design with intuitive navigation, highlighting sections like 'About Me', 'Skills', 'Portfolio', and 'Contact'. It also includes a downloadable CV option, making it an effective personal brand tool for potential employers."
